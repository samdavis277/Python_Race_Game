# Python Race Game

## Overview

This is a simple race game written in Python. In this game, cars are represented by letters (e.g., "A", "B", "C", etc.), and the race track is displayed each time the cars move. Each car can accelerate by a random amount, and the acceleration is weighted towards the middle (0) to ensure a more balanced game. The race continues until one car crosses the finish line and wins.

## Features

- **Race Track**: The track is displayed each time, showing the current position of each car (represented by a letter).
- **Random Acceleration**: Cars accelerate by a random amount, with a weighted probability distribution around the middle (0).
- **Car Movement**: Each car moves in its own random pattern each time.
- **Winner**: The race ends when one car reaches the finish line.

## Game Logic
- Each car starts at hte beginnign race track.
- The cars accelerate randomly with a bias toward acceleration near the middle (0) to prevent extreme speeds.
- The race track is printed after each acceleration to show the updated positions of all cars.
- The first car to reach the finish line wins.
